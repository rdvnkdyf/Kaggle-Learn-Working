# Kaggle-Learn-Working
# Kaggle Learn Projects
This repository contains my projects and notes from the courses I have completed on the Kaggle Learn platform. My goal is to reinforce my knowledge and skills in data science and machine learning through these interactive lessons and to document my learning process in an organized way.

# Contents
This repo has a separate folder for each course I've completed. Within each folder, you'll find Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) and my notes related to the course topics.
